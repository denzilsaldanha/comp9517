# Pedestrian Detection Application
•	Developing a Computer Vision Python solution to detect and track multiple pedestrians through multiple iterative photo frames  

•	Extracting the features of the pedestrians using Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM)

•	Using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) with an overlap threshold to filter out multiple detection boxes to only identify the pedestrian once

**Running the operation**

Run the "detect.py" as normal. And press "Spacebar" when the two images pops up to iterate through every photo in the file with the detection feature
